# 🎓 Data Science Internship at Academor 🎓

During my internship at 'Academor', I honed my skills in Python programming and key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and seaborn. I had the opportunity to work on two exciting projects, both of which contributed to my understanding of data science and machine learning.

# 📚 Project 1: Student Planner System

- **Objective:** Develop a simple and efficient student planner system to help students manage their tasks and deadlines.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Process:**
    - Designed and implemented the system independently, focusing on user-friendly task management.
    - Utilized Pandas for data handling and task tracking.
    - Enhanced the system with basic functionalities such as adding, updating, and viewing tasks.
 - **Outcome:** Created a fully functional system for managing student tasks and deadlines, improving organizational skills.
  
# 🛒 Project 2: Big Mart Sales Prediction
- **Objective:** Develop a machine learning-based system to predict sales for Big Mart and optimize inventory management and profitability.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Process:**
    - Analyzed historical sales data and key product characteristics.
    - Built a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast sales based on various features.
    - Focused on optimizing inventory management and increasing profitability by accurately predicting sales trends.
    - **Outcome:** Developed a successful sales prediction model that provided actionable insights into product demand and inventory planning.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python Programming
- Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation and analysis)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

# 🎯 Conclusion
This internship allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, working on both independent and team-based projects. I gained valuable experience in machine learning, data analysis, and building predictive models to solve real-world problems.
